# prohibited-airspace-simulator
This is a netlogo model for my agent technology practical that simulates air traffic with a prohibited airspace zone that the user can vary the size of. The model keeps track of the collective fuel used by the planes. Every patch covered by a plane accounts for one unit fuel. The planes decelerate when approaching the airport to simulate landing and stay at the airports for a certain amount ot ticks to simulate refueling.

# Application

This simplified model is made with the intent of being of used in commercial airlines in attempt to plan delays by prohibited airspaces and by measuring the extra amount of fuel used when a prohibited airspace exists for calculating financial losses. The GIS extention for netlogo can also be used to increase the realism of the model
